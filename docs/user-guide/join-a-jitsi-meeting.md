# Join by using a Jitsi link

People invite each other to Jitsi meetings mostly by sending a link.

1. If you have received such an invite link from a trusted source,
   copy it into your browser and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd>.
2. Your browser may first ask you to grant microphone and/or camera access.
   If you trust the person who invited you, confirm this access request.
   Please refer to the browser's documentation for details (e.g.
   [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/kb/how-manage-your-camera-and-microphone-permissions#w_using-prompts-to-allow-or-block-camera-and-microphone-permissions-for-a-site), 
   [Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2693767)).
3. Enter a name, which will be visible to other participants in the Jitsi Meeting room.
4. (optional) Adjust the camera and/or microphone settings via the `v` dropdown menu items.
5. Click `Join meeting`.
